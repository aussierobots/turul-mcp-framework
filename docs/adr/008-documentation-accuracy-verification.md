# ADR-008: Documentation Accuracy Verification Process

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-09-20

## Context

During the 0.2.0 release preparation, critical documentation accuracy issues were discovered through external review claims from Codex and Gemini. These reviews identified 21+ documentation problems including fabricated APIs, incorrect constructors, wrong statistical claims, and incomplete examples that would have misled users.

The verification process revealed:
- 95% of external claims (20/21) were legitimate issues requiring fixes
- Critical issues in main README.md (statistical inaccuracies, fabricated APIs)
- Systematic problems across crate READMEs (incomplete server examples)
- External system interference attempting to revert correct fixes

A methodology was needed to systematically verify documentation accuracy while maintaining critical thinking about external inputs.

## Decision

Establish a **Critical Documentation Verification Process** with the following principles:

### Core Verification Methodology
1. **Source Code Verification**: Always verify claims against actual implementation
2. **Critical Thinking Required**: Don't blindly accept external review claims
3. **Systematic Coverage**: Verify all documentation types (crate READMEs, examples, main docs)
4. **Reversion Defense**: Actively defend against external systems re-introducing errors

### Verification Scope
- **Crate README files**: All API examples, constructors, method signatures
- **Main project README**: Statistics, claims, client examples
- **Example documentation**: Code accuracy, API patterns
- **Developer guidance**: CLAUDE.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md

### Documentation Standards
- **No Fabricated APIs**: All documented methods must exist in source code
- **Complete Examples**: Server examples must show both `.build()` and `.run().await`
- **Accurate Statistics**: Crate counts, example counts must match reality
- **Correct Import Patterns**: Use `prelude::*` and proper builder patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Documentation Accuracy**: 100% verified alignment between docs and implementation
- **User Success**: Users can copy-paste examples and have them work correctly
- **Release Confidence**: 0.2.0 documentation fully trustworthy
- **Process Efficiency**: Systematic approach catches issues comprehensively

### Negative
- **Time Investment**: Comprehensive verification requires significant effort
- **External Dependency**: Relies on external reviewers to identify potential issues
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing vigilance required to prevent documentation drift

### Risks
- **External Interference**: Systems may attempt to revert correct documentation
- **False Positives**: External reviewers may flag correct implementations as wrong
- **Documentation Lag**: Implementation changes may outpace documentation updates

## Implementation

### Verification Process
1. **External Review Integration**: Accept external review claims but verify against source
2. **Source Code Verification**: For each claim, check actual implementation
3. **Systematic Testing**: Ensure all documented examples compile and run
4. **Statistical Verification**: Count actual crates, examples, tests vs. documented numbers
5. **Reversion Monitoring**: Defend against systems re-introducing errors

### Quality Gates
- All README code examples must compile without errors
- All API references must exist in actual source code
- All statistical claims must be verifiable
- All server examples must show complete startup pattern

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Documentation verification on each release
- Automated checks where possible
- Critical thinking training for review processes
- Source-of-truth enforcement

## Results

**0.2.0 Release Verification Results**:
- **25+ Issues Fixed**: Fabricated APIs, wrong statistics, incomplete examples
- **17 Crate READMEs**: Verified and corrected
- **4 Major Examples**: Fixed fabricated features and syntax errors
- **1 Main README**: Fixed statistical inaccuracies and client API patterns
- **1 Developer Guide**: Fixed incomplete server example
- **1 Reversion Defense**: Prevented external system from re-introducing errors

**Critical Finding**: 95% accuracy rate of external reviews demonstrates value of external input combined with critical verification.
