# Turul MCP Framework

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Rust framework for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. It is fully compliant with the MCP 2025-06-18 specification. The framework provides a complete ecosystem with a core framework, client library, and serverless support. It includes multiple development patterns like derive macros, function attributes, declarative macros, and manual implementation. It supports various transports like HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket, SSE, and stdio. It is also AWS Lambda ready with streaming responses and SQS event processing.

The project is structured as a Rust workspace with 13 crates, including the core framework, a client library, and 26 examples. The examples range from simple "hello world" style servers to complex, real-world business applications.

## My Role: Critical Analyst and Planner

My primary role in this project is to act as a critical analyst and planner. I will:

*   **Review and Analyze:** I will review the codebase, documentation, and tests to identify areas for improvement, potential bugs, and compliance gaps.
*   **Create Detailed Plans:** I will create detailed, phased plans for addressing the identified issues. These plans will be designed to be executed by another AI, such as `claude code`.
*   **Provide Instructions:** I will generate clear and concise instructions that can be given to another AI to perform the necessary updates.
*   **Maintain Documentation:** I will keep the `GEMINI.md` file and other high-level documentation up-to-date with my findings and the current status of the project.

I will **not** directly modify the code or create files myself. My role is to provide the strategy and the plan, not to execute it.

## Framework Compliance and Design Analysis

### Executive Summary

The Turul MCP Framework demonstrates an exemplary implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) 2025-06-18 specification. The framework successfully translates the TypeScript-based specification into idiomatic Rust, leveraging the language's strengths to create a flexible, modular, and robust system. The naming conventions are consistent with the MCP specification, and the use of traits, builders, and macros provides a powerful and developer-friendly experience.

### From TypeScript Inheritance to Rust Traits: A Best-Practice Approach

The core of the framework's success lies in its elegant solution to the "inheritance vs. composition" problem. The MCP specification, being TypeScript-based, uses an inheritance model. The Turul MCP Framework translates this into a trait-based system, which is the idiomatic approach in Rust. This is achieved through a consistent pattern across all MCP capabilities:

1.  **Fine-Grained Traits:** Each logical group of properties in the MCP specification is represented by a small, focused trait (e.g., `HasName`, `HasDescription`).
2.  **Composition Traits:** A "definition" trait (e.g., `ToolDefinition`, `ResourceDefinition`) composes the fine-grained traits, defining the complete behavior of an MCP capability.
3.  **Blanket Implementations:** Blanket implementations are used to automatically implement the "definition" traits for any type that implements the required fine-grained traits, significantly reducing boilerplate.
4.  **Concrete Structs:** Concrete structs are provided that map directly to the MCP specification's data structures, ensuring full compliance.

This approach is a textbook example of how to design a flexible and extensible library in Rust.

### Capability-by-Capability Compliance

A detailed analysis of all major capabilities (`Tools`, `Resources`, `Prompts`, `Completion`, `Logging`, `Notifications`, `Elicitation`, and `Sampling`) reveals a robust and spec-compliant implementation. For each capability, the `turul-mcp-protocol-2025-06-18` crate defines the necessary structs and traits, while `turul-mcp-derive` and `turul-mcp-builders` provide convenient and flexible ways to create and manage these components.

This modular approach, with its separation of concerns, allows developers to choose the level of abstraction that best suits their needs, from high-level declarative macros to low-level manual implementation.

### Testing and Validation Strategy

The framework's testing strategy is comprehensive and multi-layered, ensuring a high degree of confidence in its compliance and correctness:

*   **Protocol-Level Tests:** The framework includes tests that verify the correct serialization and deserialization of MCP data structures, ensuring that the JSON representation matches the specification.
*   **Integration Tests:** There are integration tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the framework, such as the server, the session manager, and the various MCP handlers.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** The framework includes an E2E test that simulates a real client-server interaction over HTTP, providing a high degree of confidence in the framework's compliance in a real-world scenario.
*   **Negative Tests:** The framework includes tests that verify that the framework correctly handles invalid requests and that broken code fails to compile, which is a great way to ensure the robustness of the framework and the quality of its error messages.

While the testing strategy is strong, it could be further improved by expanding the end-to-end and negative test coverage for all MCP capabilities.

## MCP Schema Compliance Analysis (2025-09-13)

After a thorough, side-by-side review of the official `schema.ts` and the Rust protocol crate (`turul-mcp-protocol-2025-06-18`), I can confirm a very high degree of compliance. The implementation is robust and correctly mirrors the specification's data structures.

Here is my detailed breakdown by protocol area:

---

#### 1. **JSON-RPC & Core Types**
*   **File:** `json_rpc.rs`
*   **Schema:** `JSONRPCRequest`, `JSONRPCResponse`, `JSONRPCNotification`, `JSONRPCError`
*   **Analysis:** The Rust implementation correctly defines the fundamental JSON-RPC 2.0 message structures. The schema defines `RequestId` as `string | number`, and the Rust implementation's use of `serde_json::Value` for this field is a valid approach that correctly handles both types during serialization and deserialization. The use of `#[serde(untagged)]` for the top-level `JsonRpcMessage` enum is an effective and correct way to model the different message types.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

---

#### 2. **Initialize**
*   **File:** `initialize.rs`
*   **Schema:** `InitializeRequest`, `InitializeResult`, `ClientCapabilities`, `ServerCapabilities`, `Implementation`
*   **Analysis:** The Rust structs (`InitializeRequest`, `InitializeResult`, etc.) are a **perfect match** for the TypeScript schema.
    *   All fields are present and correctly named using `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`.
    *   Optional fields in the schema (like `instructions` or `experimental`) are correctly typed as `Option<T>` in Rust and use `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
    *   The nested `ClientCapabilities` and `ServerCapabilities` objects are structured exactly as in the schema.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

---

#### 3. **Tools**
*   **File:** `tools.rs`
*   **Schema:** `Tool`, `ListToolsResult`, `CallToolRequest`, `CallToolResult`, `ToolAnnotations`, `ToolSchema`
*   **Analysis:** The implementation is excellent and fully compliant.
    *   `Tool` struct: Perfectly mirrors the `Tool` interface, including `inputSchema`, optional `outputSchema`, and `annotations`. The `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` is correctly applied.
    *   `CallToolResult`: Correctly implements `content`, optional `isError`, and optional `structuredContent`. This is a key part of the spec, and it's implemented perfectly.
    *   `ToolSchema`: The Rust `ToolSchema` correctly enforces `type: "object"` and has the right structure for `properties` and `required`.
    *   The use of a `ToolDefinition` trait hierarchy is a sophisticated and idiomatic Rust approach that promotes flexibility while ensuring the final serialized `Tool` struct is compliant.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

---

#### 4. **Resources**
*   **File:** `resources.rs`
*   **Schema:** `Resource`, `ResourceTemplate`, `ReadResourceResult`, `ListResourcesResult`, `TextResourceContents`, `BlobResourceContents`
*   **Analysis:** This is another area of strong compliance.
    *   `Resource` and `ResourceTemplate`: These structs are a direct mapping of the schema interfaces, correctly using `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` for fields like `mimeType` and `uriTemplate`.
    *   `ReadResourceResult`: The `contents` field is a `Vec<ResourceContent>`, where `ResourceContent` is a Rust enum that correctly uses `#[serde(untagged)]` to represent the `TextResourceContents | BlobResourceContents` union from the schema. This is the correct way to model this in Rust.
    *   `ListResourcesResult` and `ListResourceTemplatesResult`: Both correctly implement the `PaginatedResult` pattern with an optional `nextCursor`.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

---

#### 5. **Prompts**
*   **File:** `prompts.rs`
*   **Schema:** `Prompt`, `GetPromptResult`, `ListPromptsResult`, `PromptMessage`, `ContentBlock`, `Role`
*   **Analysis:** The prompts implementation is also fully compliant.
    *   `Prompt` and `PromptArgument`: The structures match the schema, including the `arguments` array.
    *   `GetPromptResult`: Correctly contains `messages` and an optional `description`.
    *   `PromptMessage`: The `role` field uses a Rust enum `Role` that serializes to the correct lowercase strings (`"user"`, `"assistant"`).
    *   `ContentBlock`: This is a complex union type in the schema. The Rust implementation correctly models it as an enum with `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]`. While the schema doesn't explicitly enforce the case of the `type` tag's *value*, using `snake_case` here is a minor stylistic deviation from the `camelCase` used for field names. However, it is internally consistent and does not violate the spec.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

---

#### 6. **Notifications**
*   **File:** `notifications.rs`
*   **Schema:** `ProgressNotification`, `ResourceUpdatedNotification`, `CancelledNotification`, etc.
*   **Analysis:** The notification structs are defined correctly.
    *   Each notification struct (e.g., `ProgressNotification`, `ResourceUpdatedNotification`) has a hardcoded `method` field and a `params` struct that matches the schema.
    *   `ProgressNotificationParams` correctly includes `progressToken`, `progress`, and optional `total` and `message`.
    *   All field names are correctly serialized to `camelCase`.
*   **Verdict:** 游릭 **Fully Compliant.**

### Overall Conclusion

The `turul-mcp-protocol-2025-06-18` crate demonstrates a **meticulous and robust implementation** of the MCP 2025-06-18 specification. The developers have shown a deep understanding of both the MCP standard and idiomatic Rust practices. The use of `serde` attributes is consistent and correct, ensuring that the JSON produced and consumed by the framework will be fully compatible with any other client or server that adheres to the official `schema.ts`.

The compliance is not just superficial; it extends to the nuances of the spec, such as optional fields, union types (enums in Rust), and nested capability objects. I have found no significant discrepancies that would lead to compliance issues.

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Rust conventions. The code is well-documented and there is a comprehensive test suite that ensures correctness and compliance with the MCP specification.

The framework offers four levels of abstraction for creating tools:

1.  **Function Macros:** The simplest way to create a tool, using the `#[mcp_tool]` attribute on a function.
2.  **Derive Macros:** A struct-based approach using `#[derive(McpTool)]`.
3.  **Builder Pattern:** A runtime-flexible way to build tools.
4.  **Manual Implementation:** For maximum control, you can implement the `McpTool` trait manually.

The project uses `tracing` for logging.
